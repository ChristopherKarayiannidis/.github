## ðŸ’¡ Experiment

### 1. Write down a hypothesis

- A hypothesis is simply a statement that can be proven right or wrong by conducting an experiment.

### 2. Document the new knowledge you are trying to find.

- New knowledge is knowledge that is not already available in the public arena at the time the activities were conducted. It is knowledge that can only be generated by undertaking an experiment as part of a systematic progression of work. If you are able to access the knowledge without needing to undertake a systematic progression of work, then it will not be new knowledge.

### 3. What steps will you take to prove your hypothesis.

- Highlight the steps you will take to undertake the experiment and prove the hypothesis right or wrong.

### 4. References

- Links to designs, whiteboard scribbles, API docs, Github cards, slack convo's that are related to why you're trying this new thing
